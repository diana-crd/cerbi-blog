# cerbi-blog

Code, content and HTML for [*Cerbi*](https://cerbi.neocities.org/), my personal blog/from-scratch webdev learning experience. 
Built using [Soupault](https://soupault.app) along with the [official blog blueprints](https://github.com/PataphysicalSociety/soupault-blueprints-blog). 
Site HTML based on the [*Slightly Fancy*](https://eggramen.neocities.org/code/css_testpages#slightly-fancy) theme by NeoCities user [Eggy](https://eggramen.neocities.org/main).
